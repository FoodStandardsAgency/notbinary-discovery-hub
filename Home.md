## List of discoveries

Title | Description of service | Aim of discovery 
--- | --- | --- 
[Food allergens](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-allergens/wiki) | A potential new service to establish a communication protocol between the NHS and LAs to report near-miss incidents to make the relevant authorities aware | What needs would the service meet? / Who would use it? / Is it viable? / What impact would it have on local authorities & NHS / What are the other wider service considerations? |  
[Field Ops Inspections](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki)  | Field Operations Inspections delivers official controls for food business operators in the meat, dairy and wine sectors. Inspections are designed to check that operators are compliant with food safety regulations (in the case of meat and dairy) and EU marketing regulations (in the case of wine) on a regular and ongoing basis | Discovery work has been undertaken across some areas of meat plant and dairy farm inspections but there is an opportunity to look at all inspection services, as a whole, to look for patterns of user needs | Product Owner: Hannah Rose (FSA
[Food Chain Information & Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (FCI & CCIR) Inspections](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-fci-ccir/wiki) | The FSA currently is responsible for recording and for Food Chain Information (FCI) and the collection and communication of inspection results (CCIR) to various stakeholders | Following the publishing of the FSA Internal Audit (January 2020), it is recommended that the FSA review the way data is captured and recorded for Food Chain Information (FCI) & Collection and Communication of Inspection Results (CCIR). This will ensure compliance with relevant regulatory requirements. Improvement is required particularly around the accessibility and communication of sufficient, reliable and useful data to enable effective application of CCIR official controls.
[Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) Digital Badges](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-digital-badges/wiki) | The Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) helps UK consumers choose where to eat out or shop for food by giving them clear information about the businesses’ hygiene standards | Can digital badges be introduced in the UK where consumers are presented with a food businesses’ hygiene rating when they make a food purchase online
[Helpline and Customer Contact Centre](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-hccc/wiki) | The Corporate Service Unit (CSU) run a Helpline and Customer Contact Center for the FSA for both internal and external customers | The service does not current have a tool to support their phone calls and email correspondence and ways of working, The discovery will seek to determine whether there is evidence for introducing a tool (such as a CRM) to add significant enhancements to the customers of the service.
[HR & Finance](https://fsa-hr-finance.herokuapp.com/) | The HR & Finance Service provide human resource and financial management services for the Food Standards Agency | Does the FSA need to replace its HR & Finance system? / Is there value in using RPA across HR & Finance?
[Incident Management](https://fsa-incidents.herokuapp.com/) | The Incidents Management Service detects, prevents, receives, investigates and manages incidents following an actual or potential threat to the safety, quality or integrity of food and/or animal feed. | Does the legacy case management system need to be replaced to better meet the needs of the users of the service?
[Local Authority data](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1y8npl0Krxr49Gwgh-llGiRXoNOXExKGc) | Local Authorities ensure that food businesses are compliant through various measures such as support visits, inspections and written warnings. They hold this data, not the FSA | Why should the FSA invest in improving access to Local Authority food business data? / Why would a LA want to improve the sharing of their food business data with the FSA?
[Meat Plant Inspections: Statement of Resource (SOR) & Rota](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-inspections/wiki) | The FSA provides inspection services at meat plants to deliver controls required by EU and UK legislation. The FSA does this using a mix of full-time, contract and casual staff who work across designated areas of England and Wales | There is an operational link between Statements of Resource (SOR), rotas and timesheeting. SOR and rotas could drive more efficient and accurate timesheeting through re-use of data, reducing manual overheads and standardising approaches to Field Ops workforce management
[Meat Plant Inspections: Timesheeting](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-timesheeting/wiki) | The timesheeting service helps the FSA capture time and activity related to inspection duties carried out at the meat plants, which is used to ensure they are accurately charged and paid for | Can improvements to resource management and rotas help improve timesheeting (and general field ops management) for the agency?
[Register a Food Business (RAFB)](https://fsa-registrations.herokuapp.com/) | The Food Business Registration Service signposts people to Council services where they can register a business if you want to carry out any ‘food operations’. It is currently run from GOV.UK | Should the FSA migrate the service from GOV.UK to food.gov.uk?
[Report a Food Problem (RAFP)](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1M4Ggd98bPnEhVMHwlYCo-g0suo_uWBAj) | This service, provided by the FSA digital team, enables consumers to report issues with food to the appropriate body | The digital team is spending a lot of time sorting through ‘edge case’ food problem reports that cannot be automatically forwarded to the relevant authority. There is also a concern around how useful the service is proving to be for local authorities. We aimed to test the hypotheses that a) there is a better way to deliver complaints to LAs than the current method, and b) Time spent by the digital team on the service could be reduced by iterations on the product
[Safer Food, Better Business (SFBB)](https://github.com/notbinary/fsa-sfbb/wiki) | The FSA provide information on food safety management procedures and food hygiene regulations for small businesses | The primary goal (and scope) of the discovery is to determine a) how the SFBB service is performing, b) the user experience; and c) the viability of how technology could enable improvements to 
[Scientific Advisory Committees (SAC) Website Redevelopment](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1JaJR9bDPPpgK-uCMfs61BwKy9brJG1wF) | The FSA manages a number of microsites for the Scientific Advisory Committees (SAC) and they plan on building a new microsite for the Joint Expert Groups (JEG) | These sites are built on outdated technology, hard to maintain and do not comply with the upcoming accessibility standards. The discovery aims to build up a backlog of user needs and requirements. This will be followed by a design & development phase to deliver the redesigned microsites to live. It should also be an opportunity to create a more repeatable, templated approach to building microsites for the agency.
